      "items": {
        "0": {
          "question": "How does the system create review responses?",
          "answer": "The system uses Google's Gemini AI technology to create personalized responses. It takes into account your business description, chosen tone of voice, star rating, and specific instructions you've set for each review type."
        },
        "1": {
          "question": "Can I edit responses before publishing?",
          "answer": "Absolutely! You can configure the system in three modes: manual approval (review every response), full auto-publish, or hybrid mode where you decide based on star rating. For example, 4-5 star reviews auto-publish while lower ratings require manual approval."
        },
        "2": {
          "question": "Does the system support Hebrew?",
          "answer": "Yes! The system fully supports both Hebrew and English. You can set the default response language, or choose 'auto-match' mode where the system detects the review language and responds in the same language."
        },
        "3": {
          "question": "How long does it take to get an automated response?",
          "answer": "The system receives real-time notifications for new reviews via Google Pub/Sub. Typically, a response is generated within 1-2 minutes of the review being published. In auto-publish mode, the response is published immediately after."
        },
        "4": {
          "question": "Can I set different responses for different ratings?",
          "answer": "Yes! This is one of the system's core features. You can set specific instructions for each star rating (1-5). For example, for a 1-star review you can configure a more empathetic response with a solution offer, while a 5-star review gets a more grateful response."
        },
        "5": {
          "question": "What happens if the system creates an inappropriate response?",
          "answer": "If you've enabled manual approval mode, you can reject or edit the response before publishing. In auto-publish mode, you can always delete or edit the response even after publication. Additionally, the system learns from your edits and improves over time."
        },
        "6": {
          "question": "Is the system secure? What about data privacy?",
          "answer": "The system uses official Google Business Profile API integration with OAuth 2.0, so we never store your Google password. All information is encrypted and securely stored in Supabase (PostgreSQL). We comply with the highest standards of data security and privacy."
        },
        "7": {
          "question": "Can I try the system before paying?",
          "answer": "Yes! We have a free plan that allows you to manage one business and up to 5 reviews per month without needing a credit card. You can upgrade to a paid plan anytime."
